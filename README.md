All recent updates have been deleted
=======
This is an update on the Atom to see if the update goes to my local Git repo and or onto GitHub

This is another test as I can't seem to commit from Atom

So I now know how to commit from Atom - fist I need to save the file --> This then becomes unstaged changes --> Move to staged and then I can commit the changes to whatever branch I am working on :)
